// We first import the 'express' module, which is a popular Node.js framework for building web applications. 
// The 'express' module simplifies the process of creating robust and scalable web servers.
import express from "express";

// Next, we create an instance of the Express application by calling the 'express()' function. 
// This instance, represented by the constant 'app', will be used to define routes, middleware, and other functionalities required for our web application.
